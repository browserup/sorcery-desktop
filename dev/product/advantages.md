Where Sorcery Desktop wins

* One link, all editors, the right instance
Route to whatever is already open for that workspace (JetBrains via Remote Control, Neovim via nvr, VS Code via --reuse-window, etc.). Editor-specific schemes can’t broker between brands or pick the correct window/project.

* Git-aware, path-agnostic links
Let teammates click a link that resolves even if their checkout lives elsewhere:

Include repo fingerprint (remote URL + commit/branch) and a repo-relative path.

* Your handler finds a local clone that matches (or offers to clone/checkout) and only then opens the file.
This makes links shareable (Slack, tickets, CI logs) without leaking your absolute paths.

Security policy that the others don’t enforce
Bake in the guardrails you outlined:
* Allowlist roots; canonicalize & reject escapes.
* Optional nonce/exp/sig when links are generated by untrusted surfaces (webpages, Slack bots).
* Origin binding (record who issued the link), confirm on boundary crossings, and full audit log.
Editor CLIs and vscode:// generally don’t give you this central policy layer.

* Workspace intelligence > raw path
Carry hints like workspace=<alias> or projectId=… so the handler can:
* Prefer the matching already-open project.
* Apply repo/module mapping (monorepos, polyglot trees).

    symbol→file lookup before opening.

Cross-OS and “path smoothing"

Normalize Windows vs POSIX vs WSL/DevContainer paths, handle UNC safely, and translate between host/container/VM paths. That’s painful with editor-specific schemes alone.

commit= / branch= for pinning or “open at this revision”
Existing schemes are inconsistent across editors and not versioned.

Better failure modes
When the target isn’t available, your handler can offer: pick editor, install helper, clone repo, open web fallback, or copy a CLI command. Editor URLs typically just… fail.

Relative paths to workspace for link sharing in slack, and browser links.
    The path is useful when you are sharing source code links

    git, github, jenkins, jira, 

        would be nice to offer a way to open read-only on github, too?

It seems like we need a way to delineate workspace so it can be mapped to a repo, or at least so we know when we
have one.

Value prop:
* srcuri:// links (Sorcery protocol) provide a way for devs working in the same repo to share editor hyperlinks
The only real alternative now, is github.

In slack:
    package.json goes to: http://package.json/
    with srcuri://package.json:43

* Pasting a link into slack, because of Sorcery Desktop's "path smoothing" universal links work on different machines,
with different editors, os's, and across git branches, and they can link to a given line, in an editor.
