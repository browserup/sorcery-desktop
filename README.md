# Hypr Edit

Cross-platform hyper-linker for editors and IDEs.

## Overview

Hypr Edit lets developers share code references in an editor-independent manner. Instead of sharing GitHub links that open in a browser, share `hypredit://` links that open the file directly in your local editor.

## Building

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo build
```
